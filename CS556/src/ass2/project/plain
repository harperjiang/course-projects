CS456/MA456/CS556 Cryptography. Assignment 2 (Fall 2013)
For this assignment, provide your own implementation of the RSA 
cryptosystem in any programming language of your choice.
Allow the user a freedom to choose the bit-length for their 
prime numbers. Your system should encrypt only single ASCII characters 
from text files without salting.
Your program should take four input parameters: a plaintext filename, 
a ciphertext filename, and a filename for the decrypted text, and 
a bit-length parameter. The ciphertext should be an ASCII file that 
is a sequence of numbers separated by newlines. 
For the submission, send this text file back by email as another text 
file encrypted using your own separate RSA keys. In the email, specify 
the RSA modulus and the secret exponent required to decrypt the file so 
I can decrypt it properly. 
As a bonus, either implement one of the nontrivial Factoring algorithms 
known in the literature.
