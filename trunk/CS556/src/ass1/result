this is the plain text of assignment one in cryptography 
as you have discovered by cracking this assignment it was encrypted using a basic monoalphabetic substitution cipher

for this assignment submit the following items by email before the middle of next month 

first describe the substitution table used for the letters present in the plain text 
second describe carefully how you break the cipher 
third describe and implement your own cipher system for encrypting and decrypting text files 
you may use any programming language of your choice 
also include a brief discussion comparing the relative security of your cipher to the monoalphabetic substitution cipher used for the text of this assignment
as part of the submission for the third part provide a live demonstration of your system
